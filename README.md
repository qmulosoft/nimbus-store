# Nimbus Store

This is the super-early-don't-use-it-or-even-look-at-it state version of the storage service for Nimbus cloud. Currently written in python until I'm satisfied the interface and API is stable, then I will probably rewrite into Rust for performance.

## Immediate next steps
- Better, more, idempotent testing
- Auth and encryption (maybe)

## Contributing

Probably don't right now. Once it gets more fleshed out with an actual consumer or two, I'll be ready to accept contributors
